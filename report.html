        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p class="reportText">My Web site is a fictional local club for enthusiasts of LEGO, and specifically Star Wars LEGO enthusiasts.</p>
        <p class="reportText">My kids and I are LEGO enthusiasts and also Star Wars enthusiasts, and there are local clubs in our city for each of these interests.</p>
        <p class="reportText">We have attended local LEGO club activities as well as fantasy conferences featuing Star Wars.</p>
        <p class="reportText"> I wanted to create a Web site for the intersection of LEGO and Star Wars, as I know there is a huge community of enthusiasts for both topics. </p>
        <p class="reportText">The structure of the Web site focuses on the main interests for LEGO and Star Wars enthusiasts, specifically:</p>
        <p class="reportText">
            <ul>
                <li class="reportText">The main landing page, with links to pages showcasing the following topics</li>
                <li class="reportText">Upcoming events, such as LEGO Star Wars build event, collectables events, cosplay events, etc.</li>
                <li class="reportText">MOCS / 'my own creation' highlights, showcasing LEGO Star Wars creativity</li>
                <li class="reportText">Reviews and highlights of current or upcoming LEGO Star Wars kits</li>
                <li class="reportText">Information on joining the club, where it meets, who organizes club activities, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="reportText">I have tested my web site extensively with many different browsers and access methods with different screen sizes.</p>
        <p class="reportText">In terms of browsers, I have tested my web site on a desktop with a wide-screen monitor, using Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers.</p>
        <p class="reportText">For the most part, all browsers worked fine, although ocassionally Edge would not load my local repository of Bootstrap.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I only used Bootstrap on one of my web pages, and so I added an additional web-based link to bootstrap.</p>
        <p class="reportText">Additionally, I tested my web site with the Safari browser using both iPhones and iPads of varying screen sizes.</p>
        <p class="reportText">These devices included regular sized iPhones, max-sized iPhones, regular iPads and large-screen iPads.</p>
        <p class="reportText">Finally, I also loaded my web site code into GitHub, and hosted the site using the GitHub pages feature.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I used the public URL for GitHub pages to also test my web site, which can be reached here:</p>
        <p class="reportText">
            <ul>
                <li class="reportText">https://brianvansteen.github.io/final.github.io/</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="reportText">Lastly, I loaded all five pages into the W3C Markup Validation Service, to confirm there are no errors nor warnings.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I also loaded the CSS page into the W3C CSS Validation Service, to confirm there are no errors nor warnings.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p class="reportText">For my 8th Birthday, my parents took me to the movie theatre and we saw Star Wars, Episode IV.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I loved the movie and was hooked on Star Wars for life! After the movie, I begged my parents for all the Star Wars figures and vehicles.</p>
        <p class="reportText">What made the event also special was that my grandparents joined us, and I still remember my grandfather falling asleep during the movie!</p>
        <p class="reportText">As a kid, I was also introduced to LEGO, and received many kits. Thankfully, my father saved all my LEGO and a few years ago, gave me the big box.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I always loved LEGO, and as my kids got older, I also introduced them to LEGO. They all loved LEGO, and we have a dedicated space to build LEGO!</p>
        <p class="reportText">I have also introduced Star Wars to my kids, and my son in particular loves the movies. And this love has extented to LEGO Star Wars.</p>
        <p class="reportText">So when I saw this assignment, my first thoughts were about building a web site for Star Wars and LEGO, and a fan club seemed a perfect solution.</p>
        <p class="reportText">And the best part of building this web site, was sharing it with my kids, seeing how 'cool' they thought the site is, and showing them how a web site is built!</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p class="reportText">For accessibility, I implemented:</p>
        <p class="reportText">
            <ol>
                <li class="reportText">All images include a descriptive 'alt' attribute, and also have been styled with height and width percentages to be responive when displayed on smaller screens</li>
                <li class="reportText">For the Services page forms, I modified all the click buttons, radio buttons and input fields to be larger, so they are easier to see and navigate to.</li>
                <li class="reportText">These forms all have validation checkers to ensure every form item is completed, and there is no time limit to completing the form</li>
                <li class="reportText">For the text on all pages, the font size is responsive within the page, with the page elements also being responsive. This allows the text to be made larger as needed.</li>
                <li class="reportText">Many hyperlinks ('a href') elements have been included on all pages, allowing a user to tab through these hyperlinks to navigate to all sections of all web site pages.</li>
                <li class="reportText">Finally, I loaded the web site into an online colour contrast evaluation service (listed on the W3C site), and this confirmed the colours used on my web site passed.</li>
                <h3>Contrast Report</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/report/contrast.png" alt="'Ottawa LEGO Star Wars colour contrast report">
                </figure>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Usability</h1>
        <p class="reportText">
            <ol>
                <li class="reportText">For the navigation bar and the footer on every page, the CSS grid functionality is used. In addition, grid functionality is used for many other sections on individual web pages.</li>
                <li class="reportText">With the CSS grid functionality, I am able to define grid columns and rows adjust in size, and how the HTML elements within a grid item can be displayed as screen viewers increase or decrease in width.</li>
                <li class="reportText">With the grib function, for the columns both the 'auto-fill' and 'auto-fit' keyword and the 'minmax' function were used, to ensure that when displaying on smaller screens the columns could shrink and wrap onto an additional row.</li>
                <li class="reportText">For the MOCS web page that features many images, the '@media' rule was used to have certain HTML tags not display in smaller screens, since these tags would 'clutter' smaller screens</li>
                <li class="reportText">The '@media' rule was also used to modify padding size based on screen size</li>
                <li class="reportText">For most images, the web pages include both smaller scale and larger scale versions of each image, so that whichever scale is best for a screen can be displayed</li>
                <li class="reportText">For all fonts, the font size is also automatically based on the viewport width (using 'vw')</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Learning</h1>
        <p class="reportText">The most significant function I focused on learning was the CSS grid functionality, to allow columns and rows of HTML elements to auto-adjust to different screen sizes. I had used this functionality for our group work, but not extensively.</p>
        <p class="reportText">From the group work, I knew how grids could work, but not in detail or how to modify all the different parameters that can be used for grids. Most significantly, I wanted to understand completely how 'auto-fill' versus 'auto-fit' work.</p>
        <p class="reportText">While searching for how CSS grid functionality works, I found a web site CSS-TRICKS that has a number of articles and tutorials about the subject, including an extensive guide to grids.</p>
        <p class="reportText">To learn how to use grids, I would read about a specific feature, see how it worked in the examples, and then I mostly needed to experiment with using that feature in my site.</p>
        <p class="reportText">With experimenting, it is very much an iterative process, involving adding code to the CSS file, and see how the web pages works directly in a browser. In many instances, it did not work as planned, and I needed to debug and modify my code.</p>
        <p class="reportText">What I am most proud about was having the idea myself of implementing nested grids. For my reviews page, I wanted to have each review of three columns be responsive, and also the whole section be responsive.</p>
        <p class="reportText">So I implemented the CSS grid fucntionality for both each 'review section' and also all four sections of reviews.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="reportText">I also needed to learn how to implement forms, beyond just basic input fields. I had learned about JavaScript from my prior Coursera learning, and leverage this to extend my knowledge using online searches, with much knowledge coming from Stackoverflow.</p>
        <p class="reportText">With my online searching, I gradually built up my knowledge, learning about the different field types, the different input types, the different button types, and how all of these types can be modified.</p>
        <p class="reportText">As with the CSS grid functionality, I needed to experiment with adding and modifying each of the forms features that I added. Most of these functions were applied in the CSS file, to change the size and appearance of a form item.</p>
        <p class="reportText">Ultimately, I was able to ensure the form fields were larger, the buttons were larger and had interesting styles, the radio buttons were larger, and the text was well placed. All these features also ensured better web site accessibility.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="reportText">Finally, for the forms on my Services page, I wanted to leverage JavaScript to make these forms interactive, with buttons providing messages after clicked, having the forms validated, and being able to create different types of forms.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I had learned about JavaScript from my prior Coursera learning, and leverage this to extend my knowledge using online searches, with much knowledge coming from Stackoverflow.</p>
        <p class="reportText">As with the CSS grid functionality, I needed to experiment with implementing JavaScript. What I focused on what adding JavaScript to the form buttons, to validate the input fields and to add a user's input to a list.</p>
        <p class="reportText">Ultimately, I was able to add a validation feature to the submit button that would only allow submission if all form fields were completed. The submission button would also then reset the form to be blank.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I was also able to implement a form that allows a user to enter a value, and this value would then be printed as an additional un-ordered list item, after the existing list items.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Evaluation I: Worked Well</h1>
        <p class="reportText">I am very happy with how the CSS grid functionality works, especially for the nested grids. I feel that grids are a very powerful tool allowing web pages to be fluidly responsive both horizontally and vertically.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I am also very happy with how the forms on the Services page work, and how the buttons will only submit after validating all the fields have been entered.</p>
        <p class="reportText">Lastly, I am very happy with how I figured out how to have a list on my Services page, which is part of a form that a user can add to. Using JavaScript, when a user inputs a value, that value is added to the end of the existing list.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I understand this functionality would normally be implemented using back-end tools on the server, but I was able to figure out how to make it work in the browser using JavaScript.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Evaluation II: Improvements</h1>
        <p class="reportText">I still need to learn more about how CSS styles are applied, especially how they 'cascade'. In many instances, I thought I had applied the styles correctly, only to see the page in the browser not looking like I thought it would.</p>
        <p class="reportText">When looking in the developer tools, I would then see that the style had been 'inherited' from another CSS selector or HTML element. I was able to modity the code as needed, but I sometimes still do not understand why it was inherited.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I also want to work more with JavaScript. I have taken a number of Python courses, so I understand variables, types, conditionals, recursion and other aspects of coding that are re-useable in JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="reportText">My background coding knowledge was very useful with implementing similar logic to the JavaScript used in my Website.</p>
        <p class="reportText">But I really would like to learn more about how JavaScript works in terms of JavaScript semantics and coding logic.</p>
        <p class="reportText">Lastly, I want to have a better understanding of how a web page can be laid out in terms of HTML elements, such that when thinking about designing a web page or looking at a web page, instinctively knowning what elements needs to be used or are
            used.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I feel I have a good understanding already, but when I loaded each page into the W3C HTML Validation service, there were basic errors I had made, which were easy to fix and could have been avoided.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Resources</h1>
        <p class="reportText">For all resources leveraged for my web site, I did not copy-paste any code. Any code that was leveraged was completely modified for use within my web site.</p>
        <p class="reportText">For any code that was leverage, parts would have been deleted or added to, names and variables changed, and modified how the code functions.</p>
        <p class="reportText">For two aspects of my web site, I needed to do a lot of research on how to use the code; CSS grids and forms (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).</p>
        <p class="reportText">For grids, I used three articles from CSS-TRICKS:</p>

        </ol>
        <p class="reportText">For the LEGO reviews, I used four YouTube videos:</p>

        </ol>
        <p class="reportText">For the image carousel function on the events page, I leveraged course material that I had accessed via Coursera. With my Coursera account is have worked through the Responsive Web Design course.</p>
        <p class="reportText">In this course, there is a lesson on building an image carousel, using JavaScript and jQuery. I worked on this lesson, used that code as a baseline to include in my web site.</p>
        <p class="reportText">For my web site, I modified the code extensively, updating the code (the jQuery library is from 2014), including more images, using different parameters in the JavaScript and jQuery code, and adding HTML and CSS features.</p>
        <p class="reportText">I also had completed other JavaScript courses on Coursera to acquire a background knowledge on the programming language, as listed below.</p>
        <ol>

        </ol>
        <p class="reportText">For the HTML forms on the Services page, I leveraged a topic on Stackoverflow to understand how to validate that form fields were completed before the button submission could be completed, and the form reset.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="reportText">[1] multiple contributors, 'Validating multiple HTML form fields with javascript', 2016. [Online]. Available: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41052576/validating-multiple-html-form-fields-with-javascript URL. [Accessed: August 2021].</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="reportText">For all the images, I searched on Google images, using usage rights of "Creative Commons licenses".</p>
        <p class="reportText">For my Events page, I did import Bootstrap and the jQuery library:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="reportText">https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css</li>
            <li class="reportText">https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="reportText">Finally, for all the code debugging and refinement purposes, I often searched on the following web sites:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="reportText">https://stackoverflow.com/</li>
            <li class="reportText">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/</li>
