        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>My Web site is a fictional local club for enthusiasts of LEGO, and specifically Star Wars LEGO enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>My kids and I are LEGO enthusiasts and also Star Wars enthusiasts, and there are local clubs in our city for each of these interests.</p>
        <p>We have attended local LEGO club activities as well as fantasy conferences featuing Star Wars.</p>
        <p> I wanted to create a Web site for the intersection of LEGO and Star Wars, as I know there is a huge community of enthusiasts for both topics. </p>
        <p>The structure of the Web site focuses on the main interests for LEGO and Star Wars enthusiasts, specifically:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The main landing page, with links to pages showcasing the following topics</li>
                <li>Upcoming events, such as LEGO Star Wars build event, collectables events, cosplay events, etc.</li>
                <li>MOCS / 'my own creation' highlights, showcasing LEGO Star Wars creativity</li>
                <li>Reviews and highlights of current or upcoming LEGO Star Wars kits</li>
                <li>Information on joining the club, where it meets, who organizes club activities, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p></p>
        <br>

        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>For accessibility, I implemented:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>All images include a descriptive 'alt' attribute, and also have been styled with height and width percentages to be responive when displayed on smaller screens</li>
                <li>For the navigation bar and the footer, the grid display is used. Additionally, for the columns both the 'auto-fill' keyword and the 'minmax' function were used, to ensure that when displaying on smaller screens the columns could shrink
                    and wrap onto an additional row.</li>
                <li>For the MOCS web page that features many images, the '@media' rule was used to have certain HTML tags not display in smaller screens, since these tags would 'clutter' smaller screens</li>
                <li>The '@media' rule was also used to modify padding size based on screen size</li>
                <li>For most images, the web pages include both smaller scale and larger scale versions of each image, so that whichever scale is best for a screen can be displayed</li>
                <li>For the fonts, the font size is also automatically based on the viewport width (using 'vw')</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Usability</h1>
        <p></p>
        <br>

        <h1>Learning</h1>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The most significant capability that I focused on learning was 'grids'.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
